# Gemini API System Instruction Fix Implementation Plan

## Problem

The application is encountering an error: "System instruction not supported: GenerativeModel.start_chat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'system_instruction'".

This occurs because the current version of the Google Generative AI SDK (0.3.1) doesn't support the `system_instruction` parameter in the `start_chat` method, but the code is attempting to use it.

## Current Implementation

In `services/gemini_service.py`, the code currently tries to use `system_instruction` and falls back to a workaround if it fails:

```python
elif message["role"] == "system" and message == messages[0]:
    # System message is handled differently
    # For newer versions of the API, system_instruction might not be supported
    try:
        # Try with system_instruction parameter
        chat = self.model.start_chat(
            history=[], system_instruction=message["content"]
        )
    except TypeError as e:
        # If system_instruction is not supported, add as a regular message
        print(f"System instruction not supported: {e}")
        # Create a new chat
        chat = self.model.start_chat(history=[])
        # Add system message as a user message (workaround)
        chat.send_message(f"System instructions: {message['content']}")
```

The issue is that this approach still prints an error message that's confusing the user.

## Proposed Solution

We'll implement a more elegant solution that:

1. Checks if `system_instruction` is supported without causing errors
2. Caches the result to avoid repeated checks
3. Uses the appropriate method based on the check
4. Avoids printing error messages that might confuse the user
5. Makes the code more maintainable for future model providers

## Implementation Details

### 1. Add a class variable to track support for `system_instruction`

```python
class GeminiService:
    """Service for interacting with Google's Gemini API."""
    
    # Class variable to cache whether system_instruction is supported
    _system_instruction_supported = None
```

### 2. Add a method to check if `system_instruction` is supported

```python
def _check_system_instruction_support(self) -> bool:
    """
    Check if the system_instruction parameter is supported by the current SDK version.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if system_instruction is supported, False otherwise
    """
    # Return cached result if available
    if GeminiService._system_instruction_supported is not None:
        return GeminiService._system_instruction_supported
    
    # Check if system_instruction is supported
    try:
        # Try to create a chat with system_instruction
        # Use a minimal test to avoid any side effects
        import inspect
        signature = inspect.signature(self.model.start_chat)
        GeminiService._system_instruction_supported = 'system_instruction' in signature.parameters
    except Exception:
        # If any error occurs, assume it's not supported
        GeminiService._system_instruction_supported = False
    
    return GeminiService._system_instruction_supported
```

### 3. Modify the `generate_response` method to use this check

Replace the try-except block with a check:

```python
if message["role"] == "system" and message == messages[0]:
    # System message is handled differently based on SDK support
    if self._check_system_instruction_support():
        # If system_instruction is supported, use it
        chat = self.model.start_chat(
            history=[], system_instruction=message["content"]
        )
    else:
        # If not supported, use the workaround
        chat = self.model.start_chat(history=[])
        # Add system message as a user message (workaround)
        chat.send_message(f"System instructions: {message['content']}")
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Future-proof**: Works with both current and future versions of the SDK
2. **Clean**: No error messages displayed to the user
3. **Efficient**: Caches the result to avoid repeated checks
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to adapt for other model providers in the future

## Testing Plan

After implementing these changes, we should test:

1. Chat functionality with system prompts
2. Verify no error messages are displayed
3. Ensure system instructions are properly incorporated
4. Test with different versions of the Google Generative AI SDK if possible

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement these changes
2. Test the implementation
3. Verify that the error message no longer appears

What would be good for fatigue and soreness?

Okay, let's break down effective strategies for tackling fatigue and soreness. To give you the best advice, I need a little more context, but I'll provide a comprehensive overview of potential solutions.

1. Understanding the Underlying Cause:

Acute vs. Chronic:
Acute: If it's new, think about recent activities (intense workout, travel, illness).
Chronic: If it's been ongoing for weeks or months, it warrants a deeper look.
Possible Triggers:
Physical Overexertion: Intense exercise, new activities.
Lack of Sleep: Insufficient or poor-quality sleep.
Stress: Emotional or mental stress.
Poor Diet: Nutritional deficiencies, dehydration.
Underlying Medical Conditions: (See list below - very important to consider!)
2. Immediate Relief Strategies (Focus on Symptom Management):

Rest: This is paramount. Give your body time to recover.
Hydration: Drink plenty of water and consider electrolyte-rich drinks (especially after exercise).
Gentle Movement (Active Recovery): Light walking, stretching, or yoga can help improve blood flow and reduce stiffness. Avoid intense activity.
Heat/Cold Therapy:
Ice: For acute soreness and inflammation (first 24-48 hours). Apply for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day.
Heat: For muscle stiffness and chronic soreness. Warm baths, heating pads, or warm compresses can help.
Massage: Gentle massage can help relax muscles and improve circulation.
Epsom Salt Baths: May help reduce muscle soreness and inflammation.
Topical Pain Relief: Creams or gels containing menthol, capsaicin, or other pain-relieving ingredients can provide temporary relief.
Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers:
NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen): Reduce pain and inflammation. Use cautiously and follow dosage instructions.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol): Relieves pain but doesn't reduce inflammation.
Foam Rolling: Self-massage to release muscle tension.
3. Long-Term Strategies (Focus on Prevention and Addressing Root Causes):

Prioritize Sleep:
Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.
Establish a consistent sleep schedule.
Create a relaxing bedtime routine.
Optimize your sleep environment (dark, quiet, cool).
Optimize Nutrition:
Balanced Diet: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods.
Adequate Protein: Essential for muscle repair and recovery.
Complex Carbohydrates: Provide sustained energy.
Healthy Fats: Important for hormone production and overall health.
Micronutrients: Ensure you're getting enough vitamins and minerals (especially iron, magnesium, and vitamin D).
Limit Processed Foods, Sugar, and Excessive Caffeine.
Manage Stress:
Identify and Address Stressors: What's causing you stress?
Relaxation Techniques: Meditation, deep breathing, yoga, spending time in nature.
Mindfulness: Focus on the present moment.
Social Connection: Spend time with loved ones.
Regular Exercise (But Avoid Overtraining):
Find an activity you enjoy.
Gradually increase intensity and duration.
Listen to your body and rest when needed.
Proper Warm-up and Cool-down: Essential for preventing soreness.
Hydration:
Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
Consider Supplements (Consult a Doctor First):
Magnesium: May help with muscle relaxation and energy production.
Vitamin D: Important for energy levels and muscle function.
Iron: If you suspect iron deficiency.
Creatine: May improve muscle strength and recovery (primarily for those engaging in intense exercise).
Protein Powder: Can help meet protein needs, especially after exercise.
4. Ruling Out Underlying Medical Conditions (Very Important):

If fatigue and soreness are persistent, unexplained, or accompanied by other symptoms, see a doctor to rule out:

Anemia (Iron Deficiency):
Hypothyroidism (Underactive Thyroid):
Vitamin D Deficiency:
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) / Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME):
Fibromyalgia:
Sleep Apnea:
Depression or Anxiety:
Autoimmune Diseases:
Infections:
Diabetes:
Other Medical Conditions:
5. Specific Questions to Help Me Give You Better Advice:

To tailor my recommendations, please tell me more about:

How long have you been experiencing fatigue and soreness? (Days, weeks, months?)
What activities make it worse? (Exercise, work, stress?)
Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing? (Fever, headache, weight loss, sleep problems, mood changes, etc.)
Have you made any recent changes to your diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle?
Do you have any known medical conditions or take any medications? (This is crucial!)
What is your typical daily activity level? (Sedentary, moderately active, very active?)
What is your age and gender? (Some conditions are more common in certain groups.)
Once I have this information, I can give you more specific and helpful guidance.
